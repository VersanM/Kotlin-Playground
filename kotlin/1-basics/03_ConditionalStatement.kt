/**
 * Conditional Statement
 *
 * Kotlin uses if-else and when for conditional checks.
 *
 * if-else: Standard if-else block. The else block is optional. If it is a function, the return value is the last expression in the function.
 * when: Kotlinâ€™s more expressive alternative to switch.
 *
 * Note: Kotlin does not have a ternary operator.
